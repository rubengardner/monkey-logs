# Project Brief: Climbing Logs Application

## 1. Market Analysis

The rock climbing and bouldering market has seen steady growth, driven by an
increasing interest in fitness, outdoor activities, and the social aspects of
the sport. While many climbers use pen-and-paper or simple digital notes to
track their progress, there's a significant opportunity for a dedicated application.
Key competitors include apps like "Vertical Life," "The Climbing App,"
and "Chalkboard," which offer features like route logging, community
leaderboards, and gym information. Our product can differentiate itself by
focusing on a streamlined user experience, detailed analytics,
and a vibrant community-driven logging system.

## 2. User Personas

- **The Weekend Warrior:** A casual climber who wants an easy way to log their climbs, track personal bests, and share achievements with friends. They value simplicity and a clean interface.

- **The Dedicated Trainer:** A serious climber focused on continuous improvement. They need advanced analytics, training plans, and the ability to track specific metrics like sends, falls, and projecting routes over time.

- **The Social Climber:** Primarily motivated by community. They use the app to find new climbing partners, discover local gyms, and see what their friends are climbing. They value social features like photo sharing and commenting.

## 3. Core Features & Value Proposition

The "climbing-logs" application will provide the following core features:

- **Effortless Climb Logging:** A quick and intuitive interface for logging climbs, including grade, type (e.g., top-rope, lead, bouldering), and notes.

- **Social & Community Integration:** Users can follow friends, like and comment on their climbs, and discover popular routes in their area.

# Project Brief: Monkey Logs Application

## 1. Market Analysis

The rock climbing and bouldering market is expanding, with a growing focus on structured training and performance tracking. While many logging apps exist, there is a gap for a platform that specifically caters to a training-focused user base, providing distinct experiences for both climbers and their coaches. Our product can differentiate itself by offering a unified system for tracking and coaching, empowering users to manage their own progress or to be guided by a professional.

## 2. User Personas

- **The Individual Climber:** A user who wants a simple, effective tool to log their workouts and climbs. They need a mobile-first experience to quickly track their progress, analyze their own performance, and create custom exercises.

- **The Coach:** A climbing coach who needs a powerful, web-based platform to manage their students. They require tools to create training plans, monitor student progress, and provide feedback to their team.

## 3. Core Features & Value Proposition

The Monkey Logs application will provide the following core features:

- **Unified Logging:** A single, intuitive mobile interface for Individuals to log both climbs and general training exercises, including the ability to create custom workouts.

- **Dual Platforms:** A mobile app designed for on-the-go use by Individuals and a powerful web portal for Coaches.

- **Coach-Student Hierarchy:** A system that allows coaches to assign training plans and view their students' progress in a centralized location.

- **Performance Analytics:** Visual dashboards for both Individuals and Coaches to track and analyze progress over time.

Our primary value proposition is to be the definitive training and coaching tool for climbers, offering a seamless, integrated experience that goes beyond simple logging.
